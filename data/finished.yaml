        "The most painful lesson that was repeatedly hammered home is that you can never be sure of anything.
        There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets, so it's always best to assume you're missing something."

        "I began to experience painful moments in a radically different way. Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature's
        reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me became a sort of a game to me."

        "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I 
        get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future."

        "Don't get hung up on your views of how things 'should' be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.
        It's important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity."

        "Let's look at what tends to happen when someone disagrees with you and asks you to explain your thinking. Because you are programmed to view such challenges as attacks, you get angry, even through it would be
        more logical for you to be interested in the other person's perspective, especially if they are intelligent.
        [...]If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at something you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential."

        "Get rid of irrelevant details [...]. 'Any damn fool can make it complex. It takes a genius to make it simple'
        Think of Picasso. He could paint beautiful representational paintings from an early age, but he continually pared down and simplified as his career progressed."

        "Persuasion occurs when you reach a person's heart and head - logic and emotion. You'll need evidence, data and statistics to back up your argument.
        Make numbers meaningful, memorable, and jaw-dropping by placing them in a context that the audience can relate to."

        "(...) The rule of three. Simply put, the human mind can consume only about three 'chunks' of information
        in short-term, or working, memory. As more and more items added to a list, the average person retains less and less."

        "When the brain is allowed to build two mental representations of an explanation - a verbal model and a visual model - the mental connections are not
        just a little stronger. They are much, much stronger. Add touch and you've got a winner!"

        "Many simple sticky ideas are acutally generative metaphors in disguise. For example, Disney calls its employees 'cast members'.
        [...]When they are walking around the park, they are onstage.[...] It is so useful that just by reading [..] you can probably predict how cast members should behave in [new ]situations."

        "Statistics are rarely meaningful in and of themselves. Statistics will, and should, almost always be used to illustrate a relationship.
        It's more important for people to remember the relationship than the number. [...] its the scale and context that make [statistics helpful]."

        "It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall. It is possible to be busy - very busy - without being very effective."
    - page: 101

        "The leader is the one who climbs the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells, 'Wrong jungle!'
